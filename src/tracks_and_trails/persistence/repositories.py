"""`JobRepository` — the durable queue (`T-014`, `REQ-012`, `REQ-018`, `NFR-003`).

Two properties are the whole point of this module.

**The queue survives an unclean kill.** WAL gives crash-safe commits (`db.configure`); this
layer's contribution is that every write is a single committed statement, so there is no state
in which half a job is stored. `ai/TESTING.md` §7 requires that be proven by killing a real
process, not by closing a connection politely.

**A job's `DownloadRequest` is frozen at creation.** It is stored with the job so a retry after
a settings change reproduces the *original* request rather than current defaults
(`ARCHITECTURE.md` §5, §8) — `ai/TESTING.md` §7's "settings freeze" area.

**What is deliberately not stored** (`REQ-026`, `NFR-007`, and the `T-014` scope decision of
2026-07-26): a proxy's embedded credentials are stripped before the request is serialized. The
job URL is stored verbatim, because it *is* the job — `REQ-012`'s queue and `REQ-020`'s history
are both unusable without it, and a retry cannot reconstruct it. Cookie file paths and contents
never reach this layer at all: `DownloadRequest.cookies_from_browser` carries a browser name
such as `"firefox"`, not a cookie. Log redaction is a different mechanism for a different sink
and belongs to `T-038`.
