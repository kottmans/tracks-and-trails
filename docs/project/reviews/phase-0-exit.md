## 2026-07-25 — Phase 0 exit review

**Reviewer:** Codex (Reviewer)
**Task(s):** `T-001`, `T-002`, `T-003`, `T-004`, `T-005`, `T-006`, `T-007`,
`T-020`, `T-022`, `T-023`, `T-024`, `T-025`; proposed `OPS-004`
**Base:** `158057661196adfe2730c820c6898724e446c116`
**Head:** `adb25f81019916849933c7b36091514f8d9db259`
**Platforms verified:** Linux locally; Windows from retained check, frozen-build, and desktop
spike artifacts
**Verdict:** Changes requested

### Prior finding dispositions

| ID | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `T005-R1` | Resolved | The final set-equality guard closes both former bypasses. Narrowing the core predicate to the two old fixture paths now yields 10 failures; adding `downloader/environment.py` as a third owner yields 3; adding allowed `typing` to `QT` yields 8. The restored layering suite passes all 109 cases and a real `PySide6` import in `core/models.py` fails the exact production-path assertion. |
| `T005-R3` | Resolved | At the correction head, the replacement accurately separated the T-001 entry-point scaffold from unimplemented product behavior and counted 30 modules as 27 stubs plus 3 code modules. Later T-007/T-020 work made that exact snapshot stale; that new coordination drift is `P0-R8`, not a failure of the T-024 correction at its reviewed boundary. |

### Findings

| ID | Severity | Area | Finding | Recommendation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `P0-R1` | **Medium** | T-007 geometry restore | `src/tracks_and_trails/ui/main_window.py:58-80` promises `load_geometry()` never raises but accepts TOML numeric forms beyond Qt's geometry domain. `x = inf` raises `OverflowError` during `int()`; `x = 1e100` and `x = 9223372036854775808` reach `setGeometry()` at line 173 and raise a shiboken 32-bit overflow. Ordinary but stale multi-monitor coordinates are also never checked for intersection with an available screen, so the only window can restore invisibly. The eight cases at `tests/ui/test_main_window.py:107-137` miss this class. | Validate types and Qt integer bounds, catch conversion overflow, and clamp or relocate geometry that intersects no screen. Pin `inf`, huge integer/float, boolean, and off-screen cases. | Open — `T-027` |
| `P0-R2` | **Low** | T-007 Qt threading | `tests/ui/test_app_launch.py:21-47` says both cross-thread calls are documented thread-safe. Qt 6.11 documents `QMetaObject::invokeMethod()` and `QCoreApplication.quit()` as thread-safe, but does not give that guarantee to `QCoreApplication::instance()`. The watcher polls `QApplication.instance()` concurrently with application construction, recreating a smaller undocumented race in the harness that already proved unstable once. It also ignores the boolean result of `invokeMethod()`. | Drive shutdown using only a documented thread-safe API, propagate a failed request, and repeat the launch test on both platforms. | Open — `T-028` |
| `P0-R3` | **Medium** | T-020 negative gate | `ai/TASKS.md:289-290` explicitly requires removing `freeze_support()` to fail on Windows. The implementation record at lines 325-337 records only a Linux mutation. Positive Windows evidence proves the current build works; it does not prove the detector turns red on the platform named by the acceptance criterion. The reviewer repeated the Linux mutation: the smoke exited 1 after 120.4 s and recorded 4 starts, including `--multiprocessing-fork` and both resource-tracker invocations. | Run and retain the same deliberate mutation in Windows CI, restore it, and re-run both final frozen jobs. | Open — `T-029` |
| `P0-R4` | **Low** | T-020 frozen-child proof | `_freeze_probe.py:94-112` prints that the parent and child are frozen but never asserts either value. Both retained platform artifacts happen to report `True`; a future configuration that starts the target in an external interpreter could still exchange the message and pass, weakening `REL-001`'s self-contained-process claim. | Make the frozen smoke fail unless both values are exactly true while preserving any intentionally supported source-mode diagnostic separately. | Open — `T-029` |
| `P0-R5` | **Low** | T-020 retained evidence | `packaging/frozen_smoke.py:88` writes `dist/frozen-probe.log`, while `.github/workflows/ci.yml:193-200` uploads root-level `frozen-probe.log`. The downloaded Windows frozen artifact contains only the three `reports/` files; the raw log is absent. `frozen-smoke.txt` does repeat the start lines, so the diagnostic is retained indirectly and this is not evidence loss. | Upload the actual path or remove the redundant path and state that `frozen-smoke.txt` is canonical. | Open — `T-029` |
| `P0-R6` | **Low** | Architecture truth | The two implementation calls are technically sound: ephemeral geometry belongs in a separate UI-owned TOML file, and an in-package probe is necessary to exercise the real `__main__.py` ordering; the environment-gated marker is acceptable same-user diagnostic code. But the implementer explicitly left both “reported, not decided.” `ARCHITECTURE.md:128-169` omits `_freeze_probe.py`, and the §5 ownership table at lines 173-179 omits `window.toml`, so canonical architecture no longer describes the approved tree or its first real filesystem write. | Have the Planner ratify both current choices in §4/§5/§12; no source redesign or durable decision entry is needed. | Open — `T-030` |
| `P0-R7` | **Medium** | Proposed OPS-004 | The retained spike supports the premise: real `windows` plugin, 1024×768 screen, native visible HWND/title, and a nonblank 960×640 capture. UI Automation is also an appropriate objective test surface. `OPS-004` is not acceptable as written, though. `OPS-003` lists native dialogs and open/reveal behavior at `ai/DECISIONS.md:609-615`; they appear in neither `OPS-004`'s automated list nor its remaining-human list at lines 437-448, yet its consequence would shrink the manual list to that residue. `T-026:160-162` also says a broken layout need only be visible in an artifact while its note claims every weakening fails a gate. | Restore an explicit owner for native dialogs/open/reveal; distinguish screenshot evidence from a red/green assertion; shrink the manual list only as replacements land. Then accept the corrected decision and run T-026. | Open — `T-031` |
| `P0-R8` | **Low** | Current truth | Phase-exit coordination is internally stale. `STATUS.md:65-71` still asks to merge and then run completed T-020/T-025; lines 124-138 call T-007/T-005 “in review,” describe the removed placeholder `app.run`, and state 30/27/3 when the head has 31 Python modules, 26 stubs, and 5 code modules. `TASKS.md:15-23` says nothing is Ready while placing Complete T-007 and Proposed T-026 under Ready. `TESTING.md:13-16` still says only skeleton structural tests exist. | Reconcile navigation, statuses, exact counts, and the coverage status note after the correction tasks settle. | Open — `T-032` |

### Exit criteria

| Criterion | Reviewer result |
|---|---|
| Local and CI lint, format, types, tests | **Met with an evidence-access caveat.** Current local checks pass. Retained Windows check evidence passes at the T-007 code boundary, retained Windows frozen evidence exercises the only later source addition, and only documentation changed after `41e9f6e`. The local `gh` credential is expired, so the reviewer could not freshly query the final `adb25f8` run. |
| Deliberate Qt import in `core/` fails | **Met.** `core/models.py` injection: 1 failed, 108 passed, naming the file and rule; restored hash matched. |
| Clean-checkout Linux window launch | **Met.** A 73-file tracked-only archive launched with the real Linux platform plugin, exited 0 with empty stderr, and wrote redirected geometry. T-025 separately records the full clean environment setup. |
| Clean-checkout Windows window launch | **Not met.** Offscreen UI tests and the frozen `--spawn-probe` path are not the documented end-user launch. The spike constructs `MainWindow` directly rather than exercising `python -m tracks_and_trails` from the documented setup. `OPS-004` makes this automatable; it does not supply the missing evidence retroactively. |
| Frozen child without relaunch, both platforms | **Met for the positive behavior.** Current Linux build: one start, frozen parent/child, exit 0, no orphan. Retained Windows build: the same, 128 MB, build 56 s, smoke 3 s. `P0-R3` remains an unmet T-020 negative acceptance criterion. |
| `LIC-001` Accepted and `LICENSE` exists | **Met.** `LIC-001` is Accepted; root `LICENSE` is MIT with the 2026 Sean Kottman copyright; project metadata says MIT. |

### Review judgments

- **Phase exit:** No. The Windows documented launch criterion is genuinely unmet. The open
  Medium corrections `P0-R1`, `P0-R3`, and `P0-R7`, plus their dependent evidence and
  coordination work, also prevent sign-off.
- **OPS-004:** Changes requested, then accept. The objective/subjective distinction is sound
  and the spike proves the runner can host meaningful GUI automation. The current text must
  not silently retire native-dialog/open/reveal verification.
- **T-007 design call:** Keep `window.toml`; it is disposable UI state, not a user-authored
  setting. Ratify its owner and location in architecture.
- **T-020 design call:** Keep `_freeze_probe.py` and the environment-gated start marker. A
  separate entry point would evade the ordering under test. Document the infrastructure
  exception and finish its negative/evidence assertions.
- **Orphan scope:** The resolved-executable scan catches this probe's child and resource
  tracker because frozen multiprocessing re-executes the same binary. A descendant that
  explicitly executes another image can escape, but no current probe path does that; Phase 1
  must test the real worker/ffmpeg process tree rather than making T-020 simulate future work.
- **Coverage honesty:** The count is 158, but its profile is 109 layering cases (69%), 23
  resource cases, 22 shell-window cases, and 4 skeleton cases. Nothing downloads, parses
  media, persists jobs, or exercises a real worker. Exactly one of `TESTING.md` §7's ten
  mandatory areas is covered. Section 12 states that boundary honestly; the stale header and
  raw count should not be read as broad behavioral coverage.

### Checks run

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Working boundary | Started at clean `main` `adb25f8`; base/head diff is 67 files, 3,370 insertions, 145 deletions. Review mutations were restored by SHA-256; only this review's coordination edits remain. |
| `git diff --check 1580576 adb25f8` | Passed. |
| `ruff check .` | Passed: “All checks passed!” |
| `ruff format --check .` | Passed: 58 files already formatted. |
| `mypy src` | Passed: no issues in 31 source files. |
| `pytest -q` | Passed: 158 passed, 1 deselected in 0.75 s. |
| Geometry adversarial values | `inf` raised in `load_geometry`; `1e100` and `9223372036854775808` reached Qt and raised `OverflowError`, reproducing `P0-R1`. |
| T005 historical bypasses | Narrow core: 10 failed/99 passed. Add `typing`: 8 failed/101 passed. Add third owner: 3 failed/106 passed. Restored baseline: 109 passed; hash `a2324a26...bff62`. |
| Layering production mutation | Added `import PySide6` to `core/models.py`: 1 failed/108 passed. Restored hash `ba3e24c...09cf`. |
| Clean tracked-only launch | 73 archived files; real Linux Qt plugin; exit 0; empty stderr; redirected `window.toml` written. |
| Frozen positive, Linux | 284 MB; build about 15 s; spawn 0.3 s; one top-level start; parent/child frozen; no orphan. |
| Frozen negative, Linux | With `freeze_support()` commented and rebuilt: exit 1 after 120.4 s; 4 starts with multiprocessing argv. Restored `__main__.py` hash `e085dd5b...b95`, rebuilt positive, and confirmed no process remained. |
| Frozen retained evidence, Windows | Windows Server 2025 / Python 3.14.6; 128 MB; build 56 s; smoke 3 s; one start; frozen parent/child; message and exit 0; no orphan. Artifact confirms `P0-R5` because the raw log is absent. |
| OPS-004 spike evidence | Retained output and 960×640 PNG confirm real `windows` plugin, HyperVMonitor, native visible HWND/title, and nonblank capture. |
| Final CI query | Not run: the installed `gh` credential reports invalid. Retained artifacts were inspected directly; final status was not accepted solely from the handoff. |

### Readiness

Phase 0 is not approved for exit. Complete `T-027` through `T-032`, correct and decide
`OPS-004`, then use the resulting real-plugin Windows job to exercise the documented
application launch from a clean checkout. Re-review the focused correction boundary before
advancing Phase 1.

## 2026-07-25 — Phase 0 exit corrections focused re-review

**Reviewer:** Codex (Reviewer)
**Task(s):** `T-027` through `T-032`; corrected `OPS-004`; PR #7
**Base:** `adb25f81019916849933c7b36091514f8d9db259`
**Head:** `67da109bc8de8bb02ecbd582b9d2e27710e3e981`
**Platforms verified:** Linux locally; Windows from GitHub Actions runs and retained artifacts
**Verdict:** Changes requested

### Finding dispositions

| ID | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `P0-R1` | **Open** | The hostile TOML type/range cases are rejected, and ordinary off-screen coordinates are recovered. Exact signed-32-bit coordinates still defeat `QRect.intersects()`: with `x = -2147483648`, `y = 2147483647`, width 640 and height 480, Qt reports an intersection with the 800x800 offscreen display after edge arithmetic wraps, and `MainWindow` restores the unreachable rectangle unchanged. `test_int32_boundary_values_are_accepted` checks only `load_geometry()`, not restoration. Also, the new `nan-x` case already passes at the base, contrary to the comment and criterion saying every new adversarial case failed there. |
| `P0-R2` | **Resolved** | The foreign watcher thread is gone. `showEvent()` schedules a zero-delay timer on the GUI thread, the callback checks the live application and quits it, timeout diagnostics retain subprocess output, and the test asserts `WINDOW-SHOWN` before `QUIT-REQUESTED`. The launch test passed 50 consecutive local runs and both final Windows check runs. |
| `P0-R3` | **Resolved** | Run `30186080950` is at the temporary mutation commit `a4c7214`. Its Windows frozen smoke step failed after 120.2 s and the retained raw log contains two top-level starts, including `--multiprocessing-fork parent_pid=3344 pipe_handle=608`. Commit `10bae7e` exactly restores `__main__.py`; restored run `30186222977` and final head run `30186320675` are green on both platforms. |
| `P0-R4` | **Resolved** | The smoke script now rejects either parent or child `frozen=False`. Direct injection produced exit 0 only for true/true and `SystemExit(1)` for false/true and true/false. Final Windows evidence reports both true. |
| `P0-R5` | **Resolved** | The workflow uploads `dist/frozen-probe.log`. The downloaded negative, restored-positive, and final artifacts all contain the raw log at that path; the final Windows log records exactly one start. |
| `P0-R6` | **Open** | The two design calls are now represented in architecture and remain approved in substance. The new text is self-contradictory, though: §4's structure now lists `_freeze_probe.py`, while §12 says it is “deliberately outside §4's structure”; the module docstring still says it is absent from §4. It is outside the product *layers*, not outside the documented structure. |
| `P0-R7` | **Open** | The corrected decision assigns native dialogs/open/reveal, keeps subjective behavior manual, and makes screenshots evidence rather than a gate. `T-026` still ends by saying “Each criterion above is therefore stated as a mutation that must fail,” contradicting its screenshot criterion. More importantly, `OPS-004` remains `Proposed — needs maintainer acceptance`, so `T-031`'s explicit accept/reject criterion is not met. The reviewer accepts the corrected substance; the canonical decision status still needs the maintainer's explicit action. |
| `P0-R8` | **Open** | Counts and the placeholder description were corrected, but current truth remains inconsistent. `TASKS.md` says T-027–T-032 are Ready and files their `In Review` entries under `## Ready`; `STATUS.md` says seven findings although the review has eight, says only `main` exists while PR #7 is active, and still calls completed T-007 and T-005 “in review.” This is the exact heading/status/stale-state class T-032 was meant to close. |

### Remaining findings

| ID | Severity | Area | Finding | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `P0-R1` | **Medium** | Geometry recovery | Signed-32-bit membership is not sufficient to make Qt rectangle intersection safe. Boundary coordinates can wrap Qt's derived edges, be misclassified as visible, and restore the only window off-screen. | Compute intersection with Python integer arithmetic before constructing/consulting `QRect`, or reject a narrower geometry domain whose derived edges are safe. Exercise `MainWindow`, not only `load_geometry`, at all four coordinate boundaries. Correct the base-failure claim for `nan`. |
| `P0-R6` | **Low** | Architecture truth | The architecture and module docstring simultaneously list the probe in §4 and say it is not there. | Say it is a top-level infrastructure module outside the product layers, and make the source docstring agree. |
| `P0-R7` | **Low** | OPS-004 / T-026 | The correction is substantively acceptable, but its task-level mutation claim still overstates the screenshot gate and the decision remains formally Proposed. | Narrow the final T-026 note to objective assertions, then have the maintainer mark `OPS-004` Accepted or Rejected explicitly. |
| `P0-R8` | **Low** | Current truth | T-032 still leaves status headings and several exact current-state claims stale. | Reconcile the named TASKS/STATUS lines against the actual PR and the eight-finding review before marking T-032 complete. |

### Checks run

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| PR boundary and final CI | PR #7 is open and mergeable at the exact reviewed head. Both final push and pull-request workflows are green: Linux, Windows, frozen Linux, and frozen Windows. |
| `git diff --check adb25f8..67da109` | Passed. |
| `ruff check .` | Passed: “All checks passed!” |
| `ruff format --check .` | Passed: 58 files already formatted. |
| `mypy src` | Passed: no issues in 31 source files. |
| `pytest -q` | Passed: 172 passed, 1 deselected in 0.79 s. |
| T-028 repetition | Real launch/quit test passed 50/50 consecutive local subprocess runs. |
| T-027 base replay | Base rejects `nan` already; the other new hostile values and off-screen case reproduce their claimed old failures. |
| T-027 boundary replay | Current head restores exact int32-extreme rectangles unchanged because Qt reports a false intersection after coordinate wrap. No exception or Qt warning is emitted, so the existing suite misses it. |
| T-029 Windows negative | Downloaded run `30186080950`; frozen Windows failed at the smoke step, and `dist/frozen-probe.log` contains two starts with Windows multiprocessing argv. |
| T-029 restored/final positive | Downloaded runs `30186222977` and `30186320675`; both platform matrices pass, both raw logs are retained, and each final frozen log records one start with frozen parent/child and no orphan. |
| T-029 frozen-flag injections | true/true returned 0; false/true and true/false each exited 1. |

### Readiness

PR #7 is not approved at this head. `P0-R1` is still a functional Medium finding, and
`P0-R6`–`P0-R8` are small but direct failures of their correction criteria. Phase 0 also
still cannot exit while its documented Windows launch criterion remains unmet. When the
remaining corrections are complete, squash merge is the appropriate strategy because this
branch intentionally contains the broken `freeze_support()` proof commit.
