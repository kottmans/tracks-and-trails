# STATUS.md — Tracks & Trails

**Purpose:** Concise snapshot of where the project stands right now.
**Authority:** Canonical for current project state.
**Owner:** Planner / Implementer
**Maintainer:** Sean Kottman

**Last updated:** 2026-07-25
**Last verified against repository:** 2026-07-25
**Update when:** A meaningful work session ends, a phase changes, a blocker appears or clears, or the next task changes.
**Does not contain:** Task detail (`TASKS.md`), review history (`REVIEWS.md`), decision rationale (`DECISIONS.md`).

**Current phase:** Phase 0 — Foundation
**Overall state:** Skeleton in place and green; no application behavior yet

## Completed

- Documentation system bootstrapped: `DOC-001` (convention rev 2026-07-18.1, Standard profile)
- Requirements, architecture, phases, and Phase 0 tasks defined
- Foundational decisions accepted: `ARC-001`, `ARC-002`, `DAT-001`, `OPS-001`, `OPS-002`,
  `OPS-003`, `SEC-001`, `REL-001`, `LIC-001`
- **`T-004` complete** — licensed MIT; `LICENSE` written
- **`T-002` complete** — Python 3.14 baseline confirmed (PySide6 ships `abi3` wheels)
- **`T-001` complete** — `pyproject.toml`, 27-module skeleton per `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4,
  `tests/` tree, `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`. All four checks green from a simulated clean checkout.
- **`T-003` + `T-022` complete and approved** — icon set derived from the maintainer's
  1024×1024 source; brand swatches fixed in `ARCHITECTURE.md` §8; resource invariant tests
  added. Codex requested changes, then approved the corrections on re-review; no open
  findings. Two standing caveats: no SVG exists (no vector source), and 16 px is legible only
  narrowly — `T-021` filed as an optional improvement that blocks nothing
- **First review completed** — the review process in `AGENTS.md` §3 has now been exercised
  end to end (implement → review → correct → focused re-review) and works
- **`T-006` + `T-023` complete** — CI runs on Linux and Windows for every push and pull
  request, squash-merged as `e36525e` and green on `main`. Reviewed twice; the final
  documentation correction was maintainer-accepted with the focused re-review waived.
- **Windows is no longer entirely unverified.** `T-006`'s runners confirmed, with downloadable
  artifact evidence: Python 3.14.6 (MSC v.1944, AMD64), PySide6/shiboken6/Qt 6.11.1, a
  `QWidget` visible offscreen, and the full 27-test suite passing. This discharges the Windows
  carries from `T-002` and `T-003`. The `OPS-003` interactive gaps (screen reader, native
  dialogs, keyboard, theming, installer) remain untouched and still block first release.
- Verified 2026-07-25 that yt-dlp 2026.06.09 is pure Python (1046 `.py`, no compiled
  extensions), which is what makes the `OPS-002` pip-free updater viable

## In progress

- **`T-005`** — In Review. Layering enforcement test implemented and verified; awaiting Codex.

## Next

1. **`T-007`** — application shell window. The only Ready task, and the first that produces
   something visible. It consumes the `T-003` icon set.

Then `T-020` (frozen smoke test), which needs `T-007` — its `T-006` dependency is met.

## Blockers

*(none — the `T-003` logo blocker cleared on 2026-07-25 when the maintainer supplied the
source asset)*

## Repository

`github.com/kottmans/tracks-and-trails` — **private** for now, intended to go public later.

Commits are authored as `40611149+kottmans@users.noreply.github.com`, set in **repo-local**
git config so the maintainer's personal address never enters a history that will eventually be
public. This is per-repository, not global: a fresh clone, or a new repo, needs it set again.

To do when it goes public: state that contributions are accepted under MIT (`LIC-001`), and
re-check that no personal paths or local configuration reached the history.

## Environment baseline

Development machine, verified 2026-07-25:

| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Python | 3.14.6 (`/usr/bin/python3`) — the only interpreter; **confirmed sufficient** (`T-002`) |
| `pip` | 26.0.1, installed via `ensurepip --user` into `~/.local` (no sudo, no PEP 668 marker on F44) |
| Project venv | `.venv/` — editable install; PySide6 6.11.1, yt-dlp 2026.7.4, platformdirs 4.11.0 |
| Dev tools | ruff 0.16.0, mypy 2.3.0, pytest 9.1.1, pytest-qt 4.5.0, PyInstaller 6.21.0 |
| ffmpeg | present |
| git | branch `main` tracking `origin/main`; CI green on every push and PR (`T-006`) |
| Repository path | `/mnt/storage/software_projects/tracks-and-trails` |
| Windows environment | **CI runners only** — no Windows machine or VM is available (`OPS-003`) |

## Current risks

| Risk | Impact | Standing |
|---|---|---|
| ~~PySide6 may lack Python 3.14 wheels~~ | — | **Closed** by `T-002`: PySide6 ships `abi3` wheels serving all Python ≥3.10 |
| No Windows machine — CI only | Interactive Windows behavior (screen reader, dialogs, keyboard, theming, installer) is **known-unverified**, not merely untested | `OPS-003`: push everything automatable into `T-006`/`T-020`; one real Windows session blocks first public release |
| `ARC-002` process model is unproven | It is the project's central architectural bet | **Mechanics validated on Linux** by a `T-002` probe (spawn under a live `QApplication`, structured progress over `mp.Queue`, instant terminate with no orphan). Phase 1 still proves it under a real download. |
| `ARC-002` may break once frozen — `spawn` from a frozen binary relaunches the app | Recursive launch; invisible until Phase 5 without a guard | `freeze_support()` + `T-020` frozen smoke test in Phase 0 CI |
| yt-dlp upstream churn | Ongoing maintenance cost | Confined to two modules (`NFR-008`); pinned fixtures |

## Notes

**No application behavior exists yet.** `ARCHITECTURE.md` describes the approved target, not
reality: not one module in §4's structure has an implementation, and nothing downloads,
persists, or renders anything. Treat any claim of implemented *behavior* as false until this
section says otherwise.

What *has* been built is the scaffolding that guards that behavior when it arrives, and those
parts of `TESTING.md` are real: CI on both platforms (`T-006`), the shipped-asset invariants
(`T-022`), and the layering enforcement test (`T-005`, in review). Of `TESTING.md` §7's ten
mandatory areas, exactly one — Layering — is covered.
