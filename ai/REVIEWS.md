# REVIEWS.md — Tracks & Trails

**Purpose:** Record code review, QA, and readiness findings and their evidence.
**Authority:** Canonical for review evidence and finding status. Historical record — append, never rewrite.
**Owner:** Reviewer (Codex)
**Maintainer:** Sean Kottman
**Status:** Active
**Last updated:** 2026-07-25
**Update when:** A review completes, a defect is found, a prior finding is rechecked, or a release review occurs.
**Does not contain:** The work required to fix findings — that goes to `TASKS.md`.

## How reviews work here

- **The reviewer is a different agent than the implementer** (`AGENTS.md` §3). An implementer
  never signs off on its own change.
- **One coherent change unit per review.** Record the exact base and head commit, or a
  clearly bounded uncommitted diff. Unrelated features must not accumulate into one review
  because they share a working tree.
- **Inspect the diff and the evidence, not the explanation.** A confident narrative from the
  implementer is not proof of correctness; it anchors the review. Verify against
  `REQUIREMENTS.md`, the task's acceptance criteria, and `TESTING.md`.
- **Corrections get a focused re-review** as a distinct follow-up diff, before the work unit
  expands.
- Only **Open** findings require a `TASKS.md` entry. Closed outcomes are recorded here.

**Severity:** Critical · High · Medium · Low · Note
**Finding status:** Open · Resolved · Accepted Risk · Won't Fix · Superseded

### Standing risk focus

Apply deliberate adversarial attention to these on every review that touches them — they are
where this project's failures are silent or destructive:

- Process lifecycle: orphaned workers, zombie processes, cancellation races, shutdown ordering
- Anything crossing the IPC boundary: picklability, unbounded queues, partial messages
- Filesystem writes: path traversal via rendered templates, Windows-illegal names, overwrite of existing files
- Log and history content: cookie material, proxy credentials, tokens in URLs (`NFR-007`)
- SQLite migrations and crash recovery: data loss, states that lie
- Qt threading: any object touched off the GUI thread
- Layering violations (`ARCHITECTURE.md` §4) — the enforcement test can be weakened as easily as bypassed
- `REQ-EXCL` boundaries: anything resembling circumvention (`SEC-001`)

*No reviews yet. The first will be the Phase 0 exit review, once `T-001`, `T-005`, `T-006`,
and `T-007` are complete.*
