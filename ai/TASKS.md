## Ready

### T-005 — Layering enforcement test

**Status:** Ready
**Owner:** Implementer
**Priority:** High
**Phase:** Phase 0
**Depends on:** `T-001`
**Relevant context:** `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4, `AGENTS.md` §7 (Layering), `ai/TESTING.md` §7
**Affected surfaces:** `tests/unit/test_layering.py`
**Risk:** Low — but its absence lets the central architectural rule erode invisibly

#### Scope

Statically analyze the import graph (via `ast`, not by importing) and assert:
`core/**` and `downloader/worker.py` never import `PySide6`/`shiboken6`;
`ui/**` never imports `yt_dlp`; only `downloader/worker.py` and
`downloader/ytdlp_adapter.py` import `yt_dlp` at all.

#### Acceptance criteria

- The test passes on the current tree
- Adding `import PySide6` to any `core/` module fails it, with a message naming the file and
  the rule
- Adding `import yt_dlp` to a `ui/` module fails it
- Uses static analysis — importing modules to check would defeat the purpose and could
  execute side effects

#### Out of scope

- Enforcing anything beyond the two rules in `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4

### T-006 — CI on Linux and Windows

**Status:** Ready
**Owner:** Implementer
**Priority:** High
**Phase:** Phase 0
**Depends on:** `T-001`
**Relevant context:** `ai/TESTING.md` §10, `REQUIREMENTS.md` §3, `C-003`, **`OPS-003`**
**Affected surfaces:** CI workflow config
**Risk:** **High** — per `OPS-003` this is the *only* Windows environment that exists. Anything
it does not check is genuinely unverified on Windows, not merely unautomated.

#### Scope

A matrix workflow on Linux and Windows running lint, format check, mypy, and the default
pytest suite on the `T-002` baseline. UI tests run with `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`. Network
tests excluded.

This is deliberately **larger than a standard lint-and-test pipeline**. Because there is no
Windows machine (`OPS-003`), CI carries verification load that manual testing would normally
carry, so treat the automatable list in `OPS-003` as this task's real target and extend the
workflow toward it as those features arrive in later phases.

#### Acceptance criteria

- Both platforms run green on push and pull request
- A deliberate lint error and a deliberate test failure each turn CI red (verified once, then reverted)
- UI tests pass headless on both runners
- **Carried from `T-002`:** on the Windows runner, PySide6 installs, `import PySide6` works,
  and a `QApplication` + `QWidget` constructs offscreen on the pinned baseline. `T-002`
  verified this on Linux only; CI is the only place it can be confirmed for Windows
  (`OPS-003`).
- Windows runner artifacts (logs, failure output, screenshots when added) are retained and
  downloadable — with no local Windows machine, CI output is the only debugging evidence
  available for Windows failures
- Total run under ~10 minutes

#### Out of scope

- Release/packaging pipelines (Phase 5), coverage gates, network tests
- The frozen build — that is `T-020`

## Proposed — Phase 0

### T-007 — Application shell window

**Status:** Proposed — blocked in practice on `T-003` (the logo file)
**Owner:** Implementer
**Priority:** Medium
**Phase:** Phase 0
**Depends on:** `T-001`, `T-003`
**Relevant context:** `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4, `NFR-002`, `NFR-005`
**Affected surfaces:** `app.py`, `ui/main_window.py`, `resources/`
**Risk:** Low
**Required checks:** default suite; manual launch on both platforms

#### Scope

A `QApplication` and `MainWindow` that opens with the app icon and title, has a menu bar with
File → Quit and Help → About, restores window geometry, and shuts down cleanly with no
warnings on stderr. No download functionality.

#### Acceptance criteria

- Launches and exits cleanly on Linux and Windows with a zero exit code and no Qt warnings
- App icon appears in the title bar, taskbar, and About dialog on both platforms
- Geometry persists across restarts
- Cold start under 3 seconds on the reference machine (`NFR-002`, measured and recorded)
- A `pytest-qt` test constructs and closes the window offscreen

#### Out of scope

- Queue view, settings, theming (Phase 4), any yt-dlp interaction

### T-003 — Add the application icon asset

**Status:** Blocked — needs the maintainer to place the logo file in the repository
**Owner:** Implementer
**Priority:** Medium
**Phase:** Phase 0
**Depends on:** none
**Relevant context:** `T-007`
**Affected surfaces:** `src/tracks_and_trails/resources/icons/`
**Risk:** Low

#### Scope

The project logo — a musical note over a forest trail, deep forest green with a gold trail —
exists as a raster image held by the maintainer and is **not yet in the repository**. Add it
at `resources/icons/` and derive the required sizes: PNG at 16/24/32/48/64/128/256/512,
a Windows `.ico` containing the standard sizes, and an SVG if a vector source is available.

Record the exact brand hex values in the same commit; the greens and golds cited in
`ARCHITECTURE.md` §8 are approximate until sampled from the source asset.

#### Acceptance criteria

- Source asset committed with all derived sizes
- Icon renders correctly at 16 px without becoming unreadable mush
- Windows `.ico` contains at least 16/32/48/256
- Exact brand hex values recorded for Phase 4 theming
- Loads via Qt resources on both platforms

#### Out of scope

- Full theme palette (Phase 4), installer icons (Phase 5), redesigning the logo

**Blocker note:** requires the maintainer to place the source image file in the repository.

### T-020 — Frozen-build smoke test in CI

**Status:** Proposed
**Owner:** Implementer
**Priority:** High
**Phase:** Phase 0
**Depends on:** `T-006`, `T-007`
**Relevant context:** `REL-001`, `REQ-029`, `ARC-002`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` §3 and §12, `ai/TESTING.md` §8
**Affected surfaces:** `__main__.py`, PyInstaller spec, CI workflow
**Risk:** **High** — the failure this guards against does not exist until the app is frozen, and
it is a recursive application launch, not a subtle misbehavior

#### Scope

Prove during Phase 0 that the `ARC-002` process model survives freezing, rather than
discovering otherwise at Phase 5 with the whole app built on top of it.

Add `multiprocessing.freeze_support()` as the first statement of `__main__.py`. Add a minimal
PyInstaller build producing a one-dir artifact of the Phase 0 shell window plus a trivial
worker that spawns a child process, exchanges one protocol message, and exits. Run that build
and its launch in CI on Linux and Windows.

This does **not** attempt real packaging — no installer, no ffmpeg bundling, no icons, no
signing. It answers one question: does spawning a child process from a frozen binary work, or
does it relaunch the application?

#### Acceptance criteria

- `multiprocessing.freeze_support()` is the first statement in `__main__.py`, with a comment
  citing `REL-001` so it is not "cleaned up" later
- CI builds a frozen artifact on Linux and Windows
- The frozen artifact launches, spawns a worker, receives one message, and exits zero
- **Exactly one** top-level application process exists during the run — asserted, not
  eyeballed. Removing `freeze_support()` must fail this test on Windows.
- No orphaned process survives exit on either platform
- Build and run complete inside the `T-006` ~10 minute CI budget, or the frozen job runs
  separately and its runtime is recorded

#### Out of scope

- Installers, ffmpeg bundling, icons, signing, size optimization — all Phase 5
- Qt dynamic-linking verification (Phase 5 release gate)
- The `OPS-002` wheel-extraction updater — Phase 4, though it shares this constraint

## Proposed — Phase 1 (outline; to be expanded when Phase 0 exits)

These are placeholders so the vertical slice is visible. Each gets full scope, acceptance
criteria, and a review base before it moves to Ready.

| ID | Title | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| T-010 | `core/models.py` + `core/job_state.py` — domain models and state machine | T-001 |
| T-011 | `downloader/protocol.py` — IPC message contract | T-010 |
| T-012 | `downloader/worker.py` + `ytdlp_adapter.py` — yt-dlp in a spawned worker | T-011 |
| T-013 | `downloader/manager.py` + `result_pump.py` — pool of one, progress to Qt signals | T-012 |
| T-014 | `persistence/` — schema, migration runner, `JobRepository` | T-010 |
| T-015 | Built-in presets and preset → yt-dlp options translation | T-010 |
| T-016 | Add-URL dialog with probe results | T-013, T-015 |
| T-017 | Single-job progress view with cancel | T-013, T-014 |
| T-018 | Recorded `info_dict` fixtures + adapter projection tests | T-012 |
| T-019 | Cancellation and worker-crash integration tests | T-013 |

### T-001 — Establish the project skeleton and toolchain

**Status:** Complete
**Completed:** 2026-07-25
**Owner:** Implementer
**Phase:** Phase 0
**Relevant context:** `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4, `ai/TESTING.md` §4, `DOC-002`

**Checks run** (Linux, from a simulated clean checkout containing only git-tracked files):

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `ruff check .` | All checks passed |
| `ruff format --check .` | 49 files already formatted |
| `mypy` (strict) | Success: no issues found in 37 source files |
| `pytest` | 4 passed, 1 deselected |
| `pytest -m network` | 1 passed, 4 deselected |
| `python -m tracks_and_trails` | exit 0 |
| `tracks-and-trails` (console script) | exit 0 |

**Acceptance criteria — all met.** The clean-checkout criterion was verified by extracting a
copy with no `.venv`, `.git`, caches, or egg-info, then following `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`
verbatim; all four checks passed there.

**Delivered:** `pyproject.toml` (hatchling, src layout, `requires-python = ">=3.14"`, console
script, ruff/mypy/pytest/coverage config); the 27-module package skeleton matching
`ARCHITECTURE.md` §4, each module carrying a docstring stating its responsibility; the
four-package `tests/` tree; `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` (`DOC-002` trigger discharged).

**Two deliberate deviations from "no behavior", both reported rather than made silently:**

1. **`__main__.py` contains `multiprocessing.freeze_support()`.** `ARCHITECTURE.md` §3 requires
   it as the first executable statement ahead of any Qt import. Creating the entry point
   without it would have committed a known-wrong file for `T-020` to discover later. `app.py`
   holds a placeholder `run()` returning 0 so the entry point resolves; `T-007` replaces it.
2. **`tests/unit/test_skeleton.py` and `tests/network/test_marker.py` exist.** A tree with no
   tests makes `pytest` exit 5 (no tests collected), so "pytest passes" would have been
   unverifiable. These test T-001's own acceptance criteria — importability, entry-point exit
   code, layer presence, marker exclusion — plus one guard that importing `__main__` pulls in
   no Qt, which is what makes the `freeze_support()` ordering meaningful.

**One mypy ignore exists**, contrary to a literal reading of the "no ignores" criterion:
`ignore_missing_imports` scoped to `yt_dlp.*`. yt-dlp ships no `py.typed` (verified), so this
is required the moment `T-012` imports it — confirmed with a throwaway probe module, since
nothing imports yt-dlp yet. It is confined to the two modules permitted to touch yt-dlp
(`ARCHITECTURE.md` §6), so the untyped surface stays small. Recorded here rather than passed
off as a clean strict run.

**Follow-ups:** `requires-python = ">=3.14"` is now recorded, closing `T-002`'s last open
item. `pyproject.toml` carries the MIT license metadata, closing `T-004`'s carried item.

### T-002 — Confirm the Python baseline against PySide6 wheel availability

**Status:** Complete (Linux) — Windows confirmation carried into `T-006`
**Completed:** 2026-07-25
**Owner:** Implementer
**Phase:** Phase 0
**Relevant context:** `ARC-001`, `REL-001`

**Outcome: Python 3.14 is fully supported. No fallback interpreter is needed.**

Verified on Fedora 44 / x86-64, 2026-07-25, in a clean `.venv`:

| Component | Version | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Python | 3.14.6 | the machine's only interpreter |
| PySide6 | 6.11.1 | wheel is `cp310-abi3` |
| Qt runtime | 6.11.1 | `QApplication` + `QWidget` + `QTableView` construct and show offscreen |
| shiboken6 | 6.11.1 | |
| yt-dlp | 2026.7.4 | imports and extracts cleanly |
| PyInstaller | 6.21.0 | installs and imports on 3.14 — de-risks `T-020` |

**Key finding — PySide6 ships stable-ABI (`abi3`) wheels.** One `cp310-abi3` wheel serves
every Python ≥3.10, so PySide6 does *not* require a per-version wheel and the Python baseline
is not constrained by PySide6 release cadence. This removes the risk that motivated this task
and makes future interpreter upgrades cheap.

**Baseline recommendation for `T-001`: `requires-python = ">=3.14"`.** Not because older
versions would fail, but because `REL-001` freezes an interpreter into every artifact — users
never supply their own — so there is no value in claiming support for a range we do not test.
Pin to the one version actually verified.

**Bonus: `ARC-002` mechanics validated on Linux** with a throwaway probe (not committed):
spawn worked with a live `QApplication` in the parent; the child imported yt-dlp with no Qt
inherited and returned structured info (title, extractor, 33 formats) over an `mp.Queue` in
1.62 s; `terminate()` on a hung worker returned in 0.001 s with exit code -15, no orphan, and
the parent healthy. The central architectural bet behaves as designed.

**Explicitly still unverified:**

- Everything above is **Linux only**. The Windows half of this task's acceptance criteria is
  transferred to `T-006`, which is the only Windows environment available (`OPS-003`).
- The 2-second cancellation criterion (`REQUIREMENTS.md` §11) was probed against a *sleeping*
  worker, not a real in-flight download. Real cancellation is Phase 1 (`T-019`).
- No `pyproject.toml` exists yet, so `requires-python` is a recommendation, not yet recorded.

### T-004 — Decide and record the project license

**Status:** Complete
**Completed:** 2026-07-25
**Owner:** Sean Kottman (maintainer decision)
**Phase:** Phase 0
**Relevant context:** `LIC-001`, `NFR-009`, `C-004`

**Outcome:** MIT. `LIC-001` moved to Accepted with rationale; `LICENSE` written at the
repository root with the 2026 Sean Kottman copyright line; `README.md` updated.

**Remaining:** the `pyproject.toml` license field is set by `T-001`, since no
`pyproject.toml` exists yet. Shipping third-party license texts (Qt, ffmpeg, yt-dlp) with
the distribution is a Phase 5 release-gate item, not part of this task.
